# Privacy Policy for Decenza

**Last updated: January 15, 2025**

## Overview

Decenza is an open-source application for controlling Decent Espresso DE1 machines. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data.**

The app operates entirely on your device and communicates only with:
- Your DE1 espresso machine (via Bluetooth)
- Your Bluetooth scale (if connected)
- Visualizer.coffee (only if you enable this feature)
- AI providers (only if you enable AI analysis and provide your own API key)

## Permissions

The app requests the following permissions:

- **Bluetooth** - Required to communicate with your DE1 machine and Bluetooth scales
- **Location** - Required by mobile OS for Bluetooth scanning. Also used optionally to tag shots with your approximate location (~11km / ~7 miles accuracy) for the shot map feature
- **Internet** - Used for optional features: Visualizer.coffee uploads, AI analysis, and screensaver video downloads

## Data Storage

All settings, shot history, and preferences are stored locally on your device. No data is transmitted to us or any third party unless you explicitly enable optional features.

## Third-Party Services

**Visualizer.coffee** (optional) - If you enable shot uploads, your shot data, metadata, and approximate location (if enabled) are sent to visualizer.coffee. Please refer to their privacy policy at https://visualizer.coffee for how they handle your data.

**AI Analysis** (optional) - If you enable AI shot analysis, shot data is sent to your configured AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or others) using your own API key. Data handling is governed by your chosen provider's privacy policy.
